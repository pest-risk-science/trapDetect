Description: The 'trapDetect' package is a flexible framework to simulate the 
    spread of inidividuals in a population (such as pests) over a specified
    region (such as an orchard or a block), and determine the probability of
    detecting an individual within that region given a layout of detection 
    devices (e.g. traps).
