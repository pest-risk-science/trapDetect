The goal of trapDetect is to provide the functionality to simulate the spread of individuals over a given area (such as an orchard or block), and provide the tools to determine the probability of detecting a pest using various detection functions.  

## Installation

You can install trapDetect from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dangladish/trapDetect")
```

Please note that trapDetect is in early development and likely will change significantly.

## The main function: calc_escape_prob()

The main function is `calc_escape_prob()` which simulates the spread of a population of individuals using the `sim_spread()` function if not provided, and then determines the probability of detecting an individual for a given trap configuration using `p_detect_one()`.  There are a number of optional arguments in `calc_escape_prob()` which the user can set for their own purposes.  A basic example can be run using the following code:

```{r example}
library(trapDetect)
calc_escape_prob()
```
